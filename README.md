## Style and Secrets Enforcement

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) allows us to make use of hooks that enforce style and prevent secrets from being committed to the repo. As such, it is expected that all code pushed to the repository have had these pre-commit hooks executed on all files created or updated. The configuration can be seen in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
