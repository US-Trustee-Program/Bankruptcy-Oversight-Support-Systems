## Public contributions

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a DOJ USTP open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just [send us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov) with your question â€” or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

* If you see an error or have feedback, the best way to let us know is to file an issue.
* To contribute a specific change to the site, outside contributors will need to fork this repo.
