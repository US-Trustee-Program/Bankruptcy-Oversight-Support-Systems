1. We approve a consolidation of the following cases:
   - 23-12345 Lead
   - 23-24356
   - 24-42652
   - 23-42642
1. We try to approve a consolidation of the following cases:
   - 23-54321 Lead
   - 23-24356 (already consolidated under a different lead)
   - 25-23565 (not already consolidated)
   > In this case we reject the entire approval. If the user really means to consolidate 25-23565, they'll need to remove 23-24356 and resubmit or consolidate under the existing lead

    > This is where Problem Details could be useful...
