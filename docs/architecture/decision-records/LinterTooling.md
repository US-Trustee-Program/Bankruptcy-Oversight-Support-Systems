# Linter/Formatter

## Context

ESLint upgrade has spurred us to look for linter/code formatting alternatives. ESLint upgrades have proven to have breaking changes in major versions. A decision was made to explore other options as to ease our pain.

## Decision

To alleviate package management and upgrade pains for ESLint we made the decision Switch to Biomejs as a linter/formatting package.

## Status

Undetermined


## Consequences

- We cannot implement custom rules for linting/formatting as of yet without contacting the Biome team.
