# Feature Flags

## Creating New Flags in Launch Darkly

### Front-end

When creating a new flag for the front end code, be sure to go to:

settings > Client-side SDK availability

and check the box labeled "SDKs using Client-side ID".

If you do not check this box, the flag will not be available to the front end.
